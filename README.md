# hayden's lootmath

This is a repository of personal projects where I delve into video game loot generation systems and the stuff they can produce.
For each game analyzed I will provide the source data, access to my intermediate and final results, and various visualization efforts.

To start, I am working on the weapon and shield systems in **Borderlands (2009)**.
